### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a slight emphasis on the Engineering side. I like computers, and enjoy making systems that solve real-world problems. I have a B.Sc in Software Engineering, an M.Sc in AI, and about 3 years of professional experience as Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. The majority of my professional experience involves working with large-scale tabular and time-series data.
